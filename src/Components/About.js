          Bhagavad Gita is an ancient Hindu scripture which consists variety of knowledge, that explains extensively, a lot on
various aspects, useful to the mankind at every context of life.
The ancient scriptures described many aspects and when we
corelate, for some, we could justify with scientific explanations
and for some we could not reach to that level of understanding
because of the lack of knowledge perhaps. Many of those
scriptures explained there in, are scientifically acceptable
Today, though they were described with deep philosophical
and with spiritual significances. In fact, the element, Carbon,
Known since ancient times. But, it was first recognized as an
element in the second half of the 18th century by Lavoisier. In
recent centuries, Scientists developed even technology for
nuclear weapons. More of scientific developments took
place in last few centuries. However, the ancient
scriptures are evident, that, most of the knowledge was
available, in those days. Described about various weapons in
Mahabharata for creation of fire or for showering water or for
making others to unconscious in the Kurukshetra war, which
was happened, 5000 years back as per the literature. Even, it is
discussed many millenniums before that in Treta Yuga, when
Lord Rama was fighting with Ravana, the cruel opponent.
However, this knowledge is perhaps missed-out over the
time.When, explored and analyzed“Bhagavad Gita”, the
Scripture of 5000 years old, it is understood that lot of
science was described, there in and was relevant to our
lives. Appears to be that Lord Krishna is a great scientist and
as per him, himself creates this whole Universe, which consists
of all moving and non-moving beings. As per him, the nature is
the mother of all living beings and He is the father, saying that
he provides the seed. Few of the verses of Bhagavad Gita
are discussed here in for scientific exploration of few
aspects.

          Lord Krishna said that, “for all embodied beings, those appear
in all the species, the “Prakriti” that is nature, is the mother and
I am the father as I provide the seed”. In this way, all the living
beings are created. Krishna knows, how to cultivate and make
the food, needed for all living beings for their survival of life.
He says that “I enter into the soil and support to all beings by
my vital energy. I only become the moon and thereby nourish
all plants and to supply the juice of life to all”. As per science,
we know that fertile lands only can provide the food and as per
this Shloka, it explains that he is making the lands fertile,
suitable for cultivation. Also explained, how he provides the
vital energy and moon light to synthesize the medicine in
plants, needed for treatment of variety of diseases. We know
that, for the growth of plants and for the synthesis of
Chlorophyll, the fertile soil, minerals, water and light rays needed. Krishna explained that, he provides the required
elements for their synthesis in all of them. Scientifically, he
was explaining that, how rains, he creates. He evaporates the
water of seas and makes the clouds and creates the rains.
Interestingly, Lord Krishna knows, how to digest all kinds of
foods or liquids, we eat every day. He says about the chemical
mechanism and how he is acting in the process of digestion of
all kinds of food, we eat. Krishna explained that “in the body of
all living entities, I am in the form of fire, called as
“Vaishvanara” united with the air of life, out-going and
incoming during exhalation and inhalation of breath and digest
the food of four kinds such as drinks, chewers, suckers and
lickers”. This entire knowledge which consists of lot of
science, he described in the below verses of Bhagavad Gita.

          Lord Krishna was telling to Arjuna that –“Under my
leadership, the nature brings forth the whole creation,
consisting of all moving and non-moving beings. Under this
rule, the whole manifestation is created and annihilated again
and again”.Also said that, “at the time of final dissolution, all
beings enter into my nature and at the beginning of my
creation, I create them again”. This is explained by Krishna in
the below verses of Bhagavad Gita.
<br />
bhoomiraponalo vayuhu kham mano budhireva cha
<br />
Ahamkara itheeyam me bhinna prakrithirishtadha (7.4)
<br />
mayadhyakshena prakrithihi suyathe sacharacharam।
<br />
hethunanena kountheya jagasviparivarthathe ।। (9.10)
<br />
sarvabhuthani kountheya prakritim yaanthi mamikam।
<br />
kalpakshaye punasthani kalpadou visrujaamyaham ।। (9.7)
<br />
The creation of this whole Universe is by him and therefore he
acts as a Scientist. As per the verse of 7.4, Earth, water, fire,
air, ether, mind, intelligence and ego –these all Eight together
formulate his nature, that means, all these are said as his
separated material energies to make all these creations through
them.Krishna explained Arjuna that “whatever and wherever
you see opulent, beautiful and glorious manifestations of
creation, you should understand those to be just a spark of my
splendor”- as per the verse of 10.41 of Bhagavad Gita.
Yadyadvibhoothimat sathvam sree madur jithameva va।
thathadevavagachchtvam mama thejomsasambhavam।। (10.41)
Also explained in the verses 14.4, 15.3, 9.19 and in 15.14 about
the creation all the living beings and the facilitation of all
requirements for their survival.
